## Getting Started with Anaconda

### Launching Anaconda Navigator

1. **Access:** Go to Start Menu → Type "Anaconda" → Open "Anaconda Navigator"
2. **Interface:** The Navigator provides access to various tools:
   - **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive coding environment
   - **Jupyter Lab** - Advanced notebook interface
   - **Spyder** - IDE for Python development
   - **Other tools** - Additional development applications

### Using Jupyter Notebook

#### Launching Jupyter

1. **From Navigator:** Click "Launch" under Jupyter Notebook
2. **Browser Interface:** Opens in your default web browser
3. **File System:** Shows your computer's directory structure (Desktop, Downloads, Documents)

#### Creating Your First Notebook

1. **Navigation:** Browse to your desired folder (e.g., Downloads)
2. **New Notebook:** Click "New" → "Python 3" notebook
3. **Interface:** Opens a new tab with an interactive Python notebook

#### Basic Jupyter Operations

**Running Code:**

- Type Python code in cells
- **Method 1:** Click "Run" button
- **Method 2:** Press `Shift + Enter` (recommended shortcut)

**Example Code to Test:**

```python
# Basic output
print("Hello World")

# Variable assignment and display
print("My name is Zain")

# Mathematical operations
a = 1 + 3
print(a)  # Shows output: 4

# Direct value display (without print)
a  # Shows: 4
```
